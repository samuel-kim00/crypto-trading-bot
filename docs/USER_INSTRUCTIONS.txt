# Trading Bot Health & Learning Check Instructions

This guide will help you verify that your trading bot is:
- Gathering info from all APIs
- Learning and updating strategies
- Running properly

## 1. Is the bot gathering info from all APIs?

**How to check:**
- Open `trading_bot.log` and look for entries like:
  - Fetched market data for [symbol]
  - Fetched Reddit sentiment
  - Fetched YouTube analysis
  - Fetched news articles
  - Fetched CryptoCompare signals
- Check for errors or warnings about API failures.

**What to do:**
- Open a terminal and run:
  ```sh
  tail -n 50 trading_bot.log
  ```
- If you see errors like "API key missing" or "Failed to fetch...", check your `.env` file and API quotas.

## 2. Is the bot learning and updating strategies?

**How to check:**
- Look for log entries like:
  - Model training completed
  - Training accuracy: ...
  - Testing accuracy: ...
  - Loaded existing trading model
- Strategy parameters should update in response to new sentiment/volatility/news.

**What to do:**
- Search the log for "training", "accuracy", or "Loaded existing trading model".
- Check if strategy parameters change after major news or sentiment shifts.

## 3. Is the bot running properly?

**How to check:**
- The log should show a continuous loop of:
  - Checking positions
  - Fetching new data
  - Making trading decisions
  - Executing trades (simulated or real)
- No repeated errors or crashes in the log.
- The dashboard (if running) should update with new trades, balances, and performance stats.

**What to do:**
- Tail the log file:
  ```sh
  tail -n 50 trading_bot.log
  ```
- Check the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:5000 for live updates.
